# Choosing a Neighbourhood
San Francisco is a city of neighbourhoods, with a pretty different vibe and
lifestyle despite being not too far apart. The neighbourhood you live in will
have a profound impact on your experience living here. Manasi and I had the
luxury of already living in the Bay Area, and so we spent several weekends
just hanging out in a variety of places to see what we liked. Would recommend
doing the same, if you have the option. FWIW, We live in the Mission, and
love it.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/kegeax/comment/gg2r4p4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
is a good writeup I found about SF neighborhoods on Reddit. Caveats emptor,
that it is just one person's opinion, and it might be a bit outdated (e.g. she
calls the mission up-and-coming, which is definitely not how I'd put it). Pretty
solid, nonetheless.

# Transportation
Driving in the city is a pain, and parking is expensive. When I'm in the
city I primarily rely on public transportation to get around. E-bikes are
another good option, either your own or City Bikes.
The broader Bay Area, is a car-dependent suburb like the rest of the US, and
access to a car is good for out of town trips. We own a car that we end up
driving maybe once a week. My brother gets a rental car when he needs.

A note on public transportation: it is mostly buses, and your experience will
vary widely depending on where you live. Mission Street (where I live) has 3 bus
routes, each with a six minute frequency at peak. Plus a BART train every 3-4
minutes. Bernal Heights has one bus route, with a 20 minute frequency, which is
a lot worse. Owning a car is probably less painful in Bernal than in Misison
though.
