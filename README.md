Ravi's website
===================

This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [bibble](https://github.com/sampsyo/bibble) to generate a static website
complete with publications. It uses [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) to make things pretty. Credits to the 
[SAMPA website](http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/) off which this was cloned. 


Editing
-------

Most pages are just Markdown or HTML files that you can edit directly. News is
generated from _posts.

Try editing directly in GitHub! It's like magic.


News Items and Blog Posts
-------------------------

For both long-form blog posts and short news updates, we use Jekyll's blogging system. To post a new item of either type, you create a file in the _posts directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title-for-url.md`. The date part of the filename always matters; the title part is currently only used for full blog posts (but is still required for news updates).

The file must begin with [YAML front matter][yfm]. For news updates, use this:

    ---
    layout: post
    shortnews: true
    ---

For full blog posts, use this format:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Some Great Title Here"
    ---

And concoct a page title for your post. The body of the post goes after the `---` in either case.

Bibliography
----------------------
pubs.html is generated using pybtex. It reads pubs.bib and generates the list of
publications in chronological order. The URL to the paper is read from the bibtex
if it exists, and the default location is scanned for a PDF otherwise. To change
the default location, change the 'papersdir' variable in bibble/bibble.py

Building and Deploying
----------------------

The requirements for building the site are:

* [Jekyll][]: run `gem install jekyll`
* [Pybtex][]: run `pip install pybtex`
* [bibble][]: included in the repo, and tweaked slightly

`make` compiles the bibliography and the website content to the `_site`
directory. To preview the site, run `jekyll serve`` and head to
http://0.0.0.0:4000.

To upload a new version of the site via rsync over ssh, type `make deploy`. A web hook does this automatically when you push to GitHub.

If you use an alternative Python when building the bibliography, use `make
PYTHON=/path/to/python`.
