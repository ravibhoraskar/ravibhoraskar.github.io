Pretend that you are in a plane. Closed. Flying 36000 feet in the air. Trapped. No escape. You try to sleep it off with the cheap alcohol. Fake smiles. Standing in line for the tiny toilets. Trapped. No escape. But then imagine your destination. Your home for the next five years. And the sense of curiosity and trepidation replaces dread. And then realize that you are already at your destination. "I'm here already!", you whisper to yourself with wonder. There's no apprehension anymore; just a question, "What's next?". Seattle welcomes you to an embrace – a cloudy one – but still strangely warm and inviting. "Welcome home, Ravi", he whispers in your ear. And you smile as you step out of the airport, and reply,

"Hello Seattle! Great to finally meet you."
