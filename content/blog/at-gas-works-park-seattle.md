<p>As he gazes down upon people<br />
playing<br />
on his cool ferrous body, does<br />
the metal giant<br />
of Gas Works Park<br />
feel<br />
like<br />
the last dinosaur<br />
did, when he was displaced<br />
by smaller agile creatures<br />
on Earth?<br />
Archaic, unwieldy,<br />
irrelevant.</p>
<p>But beautiful.</p>
