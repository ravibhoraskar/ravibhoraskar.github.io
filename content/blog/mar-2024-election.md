Here is how I am voting on the ballot propositions on the election today. I did
this in the [November 2022](/blog/2022/10/10/nov-2022-election) election, and
the act of writing this up made me read up and study them more thoroughly, so
doing it again.

This election, I thought I'd save some paper by not having the printed voter
material mailed to me and read the PDFs instead. This turned out to be a mistake
as I never got around to actually doing it till today, election day. Next time,
I'll ask for paper.

## Ballot Measures: State
In general, I think it is better for laws to be passed by the legislature than
by ballot measure. There is more flexibility — a law passed by ballot measure
can’t be repealed by the legislature, and ballot measures are fairly cumbersome
and expensive to do over. There is also less nuance possible — while there’s
debate and discussion, and the law goes through several revisions as it passes
through committee, state assembly, and state senate, ballot propositions need a
yes/no vote and are passed as written.

Thus, when deciding how to vote on a ballot measure, I try to answer two
questions: (1) is it good policy, and (2) does it meet the bar for a ballot
measure to pass a law. The answer to *both* should be in the affirmative for me
to vote yes.

- **Prop 1: Mental Health Bond — <span style="color:green;">YES</span>**:
Both the state assembly and senate passed this law by a pretty high margin, but
issuing new bonds needs approval by voters, so this also needs a ballot measure.
Do I think this is good policy? I am not sure --- while housing and mental
health are important issues, California already spends a lot on them already.
Since I feel strongly about the legislature passing laws, I will let the
near-unanimous votes by them be my tiebreaker, and begrudgingly vote yes

## Ballot Measures: City
While my overall thinking around city ballot measures is similar to how I think
of the state-level ones, I lower my bar to vote Yes for a measure at the city
level somewhat, compared to state level ones (if I think it is sound policy) for
a few reasons. One is that I think the San Francisco board of supervisors is a
particularly dysfunctional government body, and so some direct oversight is
good. The second is that city elections happen more frequently than state-wide
ones, so these are slightly easier to amend. They are still incredibly expensive
and wasteful, though, so I might vote no for what I think is good policy, if I
think it should pass legislatively instead.

- **Prop A: Affordable Housing Bonds — <span style="color:green;">YES</span>**:
Same as Prop 1 above: voting yes only because the mayor as well as the board of
supervisors think this is good policy.

- **Prop B: Police Staffing — <span style="color:red;">NO</span>**: There is no
reason for this to be a ballot measure and should be passed by the mayor and the
board of supervisors if they really want it.

- **Prop C: Tax Exemption for Office to Housing conversion —
<span style="color:green;">YES</span>**: I think the evolution of Manhattan's
financial district from an area with just offices to now being more of a mixed
use neighbourhood has been encouraging, and SF's financial district could follow
the same model. Voting yes.

- **Prop D: Ethics Laws — <span style="color:red;">NO</span>**: Voting NO for
primarily for flexibility reasons: rules made by ballot proposition can only be
overruled by ballot proposition. I'd be happy to support this law if it were
being passed legislatively.

- **Prop E: Police Department Procedures — <span style="color:red;">NO</span>**:
Policy matters should not be decided on the ballot box. This is very solidly in
the domain of the Mayor and the police department, and there's no reason for the
voters to weigh in. FWIW, I do think speeding cameras in particular are good
policy — taking away human judgement from enforcing minor violations is good to
minimize bias, and frees up the police to pursue more important crimes.

- **Prop F: Illegal Substance Dependence Screening — <span style="color:red;">
NO</span>**: Another policy decision that voters shouldn't really need to weigh
in on

- **Prop G: Algebra in Eighth Grade — <span style="color:red;">NO</span>**:
And yet another one.

If you want to discuss or debate or change my mind about any of these, please
