Ravi Bhoraskar is not a penguin. He is a software Engineer at Facebook, and a graduate
student on leave from the Computer Science
department at the University of Washington. <s>One day, he shall return &mdash; a prodigal son &mdash; and finish his PhD.</s>
Although he is interested in
everything that exists in the universe, he currently focuses on mobile
systems, and is driven by a strong desire to learn everything there is to learn about
Android, to help make mobile
apps suck less. He enjoys solving puzzles, playing racquet sports,
and <a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html">gyring and gimbling</a> in the wabe with the slithy
toves and mimsy borogoves.
