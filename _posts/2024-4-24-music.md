I went to Apoorvaa's concert, and she talked about her classical musical heritage.
I have what I'd call a classical music appreciation heritage.

Bhaiya used to do guess-the-raag on the radio, was friends with Kumar etc

Ma organizes concert series

Classical music at special occassions — jiji Pooja, mamma munja, etc
