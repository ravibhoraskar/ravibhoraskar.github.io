<p>Thinking through names to give Manasi and my daughter, I thought that writing out the framework that we're working with would help. These are not meant to be an objective list of criteria, just a codification of my preferences. These are roughly arranged in the order of preference (e.g. having an easy to pronounce name is more important than having a two-syllable name). Feedback, comments, and name suggestions are all welcome. <a href="https://forms.gle/YT59sDZF2tQ4aDXg8">Please submit them using this form</a>. Thank you!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to pronounce and not butchered by either English and Indian speakers
<ul>
<li>e.g. Sarwadnya (hard to pronounce for English or non-Marathi Indian speakers)</li>
<li>e.g. Pooja (often pronounce Poo-ha in California because of the spanish influence)</li>
<li>e.g. Theo (the fricative “<strong>θ” </strong>doesn’t exist in Indian languages)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meaning should not be weird, offensive, etc in English, Spanish, Hindi, Marathi
<ul>
<li>e.g. Hardik: Hard Dick</li>
<li>e.g. Laura: when pronounced the Spanish way, sounds a lot like लौडा</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two syllable names preferred
<ul>
<li>I have empirically observed that people with both longer and shorter names end up getting two syllable nicknames</li>
<li>e.g. Aditya → Adu; Cleopatra → Cleo</li>
<li>This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, just not my preference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prefer simple syllables over consonant clusters (जोडाक्षरे नको)</li>
<li>Prefer “classic” names over “unique” ones
<ul>
<li>e.g. prefer Kunal to Krunal; prefer Katie to Kassiani</li>
<li>This also helps somewhat with internet anonymity, which is a good thing in the modern world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prefer names with some ethnic ambiguity
<ul>
<li>e.g. Tanya or Nina could be Indian or Russian</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
