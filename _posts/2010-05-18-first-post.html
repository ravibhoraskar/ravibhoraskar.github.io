This blog shall documents the accounts of my Summer of 2010 that I spent in Boston, doing an internship at Boston University. However, I shall strive to keep it interesting and not become a Dear Diary blog, like most other travel blogs eventually do. It shall have my travel accounts, interspersed with digressions about random thoughts that cross my mind when I'm writing. Read the first post to know what I mean.<br />Enjoy
