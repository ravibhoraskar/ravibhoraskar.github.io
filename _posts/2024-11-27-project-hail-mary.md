I finished reading Andy Weir's _Project Hail Mary_ yesterday, and it was
probably the best science fiction book I've read in a long time. It is
unapologetic about being fairly science-forward --- relativity, base-6 numbers,
and the Krebs cycle all appear as fairly important plot points. It felt a lot
like an old-fashioned science-fiction book, like something Arthur C. Clarke
would've written. Indeed, using a centrifuge to create gravity in a spaceship is
an idea that directly appears in
[_Rendezvous with Rama_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama) as
well.

Modern media generally takes a fairly cynical view of humanity. In
[_Don't look up (2021)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up), a comet
threatens to destroy the planet. In an allegory for our collective in action on
climate change, mankind does nothing and earth is destroyed.
_Project Hail Mary_ is far more optimistic.  In the book,
all the world powers come together to work on a megaproject to save
mankind from an extinction-level crisis. There is no antagonist in the book, and
even the intelligent alien life-form that we encounter is friendly, curious, and
cooperates with our protagonist to solve the
problem at hand. The overall tone of the book filled with optimism rather than
cynicism, felt oddly old-fashioned as well.

In my lifetime, we have curbed Ozone layer depletion, and shrunk the Antarctic
ozone hole. Global treaties have reduced SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and Acid Rain
is mostly a managed problem. But in the last decade we've also seen a rise of
climate denial and a global tendency toward isolationism. The COVID-19 tragedy
both showed the success of international cooperation, and exposed tensions
driven by national interests.

_Project Hail Mary_ came as a breath of fresh air to the often bleak narratives
we encounter today. It reminded me of my love of all sciences, and rekindled my
faith in the power of humanity to solve our problem. Great read, would
recommend!
