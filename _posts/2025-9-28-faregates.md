title: Absence of fare gates makes great transit

Unlike the American, Indian, Japanese, British, or French metros 
I've been on, transit in the German-speaking part 
of the world has no fare gates. Instead, they use 
proof-of-payment i.e. random checking by inspectors and fines 
if you fail to show a valid ticket. I've previously encountered 
these on commuter rail (Mumbai Local, Caltrain), but Germany 
and Switzerland use it everywhere, including on buses, trams, 
and urban rail. Having extensively used transit in Berlin and 
Zürich on a recent trip, I can confidently 
say this is the superior system. There are many reasons for 
this:
- **Easier to navigate**: Trying to make a connection at a giant 
interchange station can be daunting in a new city. It’s even worse 
when accidentally going the wrong way means exiting the station 
and paying a new fare (this happened to me in Boston). 
Train stations in Berlin, though, felt very open --- even large ones 
like the Hauptbahnhof. And if you end up on the wrong platform, 
or outside the station, you can just walk back in
- **Simpler station design**: the average non-interchange underground 
station in Berlin is simply a staircase or elevator leading to the 
platform. There is no need for a mezzanine level with ticket 
machines and additional circulation area before the gates, 
because the ticket machines are just put directly on the platform. 
Alon levy has spoken about how this [lowers construction 
costs](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2021/01/29/fare-control-and-construction-costs/),
but it also leads to less walking for travelers, which I appreciated
- **More exits**: I observed the average station in Berlin had a lot 
more exits than, say, BART does. This probably follows from the 
simpler station design, and lower cost of building an additional entrance
- **Better Accessibility**: Wheelchair access is important, and 
designing for it also helps people traveling with strollers or luggage.
Fare control is often one of the choke points where accessibility gets 
tricky. In Paris last week, as we were taking the métro to the airport, we 
really struggled with turnstiles. My dad tagged his card and pushed 
his suitcase through first, but then the turnstile locked and he 
couldn’t get through himself (he ended up jumping the turnstile to get in). 
We could have looked for a wider wheelchair entrance or pushed 
the bag under the gate, but this problem would never have happened in 
Berlin, since turnstiles don’t exist there
- **Easier transfers**: London generally doesn’t let you re-enter the 
fare zone once you exit. Certain stations that are close by but not 
connected inside the fare zone allow free out-of-station transfers 
within specific time limits, but it’s a complicated system that even 
locals find confusing. In Berlin, in contrast, an out-of-station 
transfer is functionally the same as an in-station one, since the 
concept of a fare zone does not exist
