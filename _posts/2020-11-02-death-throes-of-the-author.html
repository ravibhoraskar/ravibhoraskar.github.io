<p>The last paragraph of O Henry's <em><a href="https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/pdf/passage/2387/the-four-million-002-the-gift-of-the-magi.pdf">The Gift of the Magi</a></em> makes me like it a lot less. Had the story just ended with the reveal of Jim having sold his watch, the reader could've read the story as an everyday tragedy, as a snapshot of bitter ironies in life, or just a sardonic take of human nature. The author, though, chooses to moralize, saying <em>"...two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house"</em>, and imposing upon the reader his own interpretation. </p>
<p>Roland Barthes in his iconic essay <em>Death of the Author</em> argues against incorporating the author's intentions and biographical context into literary analysis, and instead suggests analysing solely the text. Does the author wish to give up their text, though? I wonder if paragraphs like this one are the death throes of the author, a last attempt to exert control over their creation before it leaves them. </p>
<p>Take Sahir Ludhianvi's <em><a href="https://hindilyricspratik.blogspot.com/2011/04/laga-chunari-mein-daag-manna-dey.html">Laaga Chunari mein Daag</a></em>, immortalized by Manna Dey in raag bhairavi. The चुनरी, ससुराल, and दाग could probably have a dozen interpretations. The last antara before the tarana begins, however, goes: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>कोरी चुनरिया आत्मा मोरी, मैल है माया जाल<br />वो दुनिया मोरे बाबुल का घर, ये दुनिया ससुराल</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>and just like that, the poet snatches away the dozen interpretations from the listener, by explaining their own interpretation of the metaphor within the text. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Mind you, the temptation to editorialize your own work is very real, and I've experienced it myself — perhaps most often when posting an Instagram story, and feeling the need to put a caption on it. My main reason, I think, is that people viewing my story won't "get it", because I'm not a good enough storyteller. Do the Ludhianvis and Henrys of the world feel this too? Perhaps more apt than death throes, then, might be to call this Insecurity of the Author. </p>
