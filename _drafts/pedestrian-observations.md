title: Pedestrian Observations from India trip
type: post

I'm visiting India for the first time since moving into San Francisco from the suburbs, here are some hot takes about walkablity and urbanism. 

- Indian cities feel more walkable than American suburbs, but less walkable than American cities
- The 'more walkable than suburbs' largely comes from zoning --- all places I've lived in India are mixed use by default, and as a result there's generally a paan shop, a tea stall, and often a grocery store that you can walk to
- The 'less walkable than cities' is because the urban environment is quite hostile to pedestrians --- sidewalks are either nonexistent, or unusable thanks to shops and parked vehicles, drivers don't respect pedestrian right of way, honking is way more common than in the US. Walking is thus loud, unpleasant and stressful
- Thanks to  poor (or maybe lack of?) urban planning, streets are laid out haphazardly rather than in a grid, making distances longer than they need to be. Here's an example comparing walking a similar distance near my in-laws' neighbourhood in Pune, and my neighbourhood in San Francisco
