title: The Joy of Learning
type: post

In today's parenting class our teacher Nancy asked us about values
that our family had growing up. Thinking back to my childhood, one
that stood out was the love of learning.

It must've been 1994 when we first got a computer in the house,
relatively early for an Indian household wihout engineers or
tech-people in it. My grandfather Bhaiya was determined to learn
how to use it. I remember him going to computer classes, and
eventually getting a private tutor all through his 70s and 80s.
He was so proud to be able to send emails to brag about his
grandkids' accomplishments!

When he was about 50 years old, my father discovered fitness.
He quit smoking, learned how to swim, developed a
gym routine, and started a diet. Over the years, he also
developed a love for climing mountains, and spends some time
every summer in the Himalayas. More recently, long distance
running has been his passion, and a couple marathons have been
added to the annual calendar.

My mother joined a class at the local university to learn how
to use PowerPoint, so that she could make slides to more
effectively teach her junior doctors. Always a fan of listening
to Hindustani classical music, she started learning to sing
it in this last decade. With a scientific approach to cooking,
she's never satisfied till she's tinkered with a recipe to
perfection, and made it her own.

Growing up, my brother and I were always enrolled in some
class or the other: music, arts --- I often joke that I've
tried and failed to be good at nearly every sport that is
played in Indore. Mother once bought me a typing
tutor CD because she felt touch typing was an important skill
to know (the software worked. I can now type at 100wpm).
Excelling was never expected, but trying new things was.

The love of learning and constant self-improvement is something
I must've taken granted growing up, but reflecting on it now
see how special of a family value it really is. I hope to
be able to pass it on to Tanya as well.
