title: Cool things I saw in Tokyo
type: post
---

Visiting Japan from the US for the first time felt similar to visiting the US
from India --- like coming to a more advanced place. Significantly better public
amenities and focus on everyday convenience means that quality of life felt
significantly better. Here are some cool things I saw there

## Baby infrastructure

Traveling with a young baby meant frequent breaks to feed and change diapers. I
was blown away by the abundance of well stocked baby rooms. The nursing rooms had
air conditioning, a bottle warmer, a seat to put the baby to bottle feed,
changing tables, and a comfy lounge chair to breastfeed. In Tokyo, we generally
found one at no more than a 10 minute walk from wherever we were, and the
[Mamapapamap App](

made them super easy to find too.

## Smoking
In America, smoking indoors is generally disallowed, but smoking outdoors is
okay. In Japan, it is the opposite --- I rarely came across people smoking
outdoors, but routinely found them smoking inside. Weird? Not really. There are
designated smoking areas with fans and vents to make sure nobody who didn't
willingly agree to be exposed to cigarette smoke gets exposed to cigarette
smoke, including people outdoors going about their day.

## Street Design

The typical neighborhood street in Tokyo was significantly more compact than the
ones in San Francisco. No street parking, no sidewalks, no trees, no bike lanes.
Pedestrians, bicyclists, and cars share the same space. Walking actually felt a
lot more pleasant than you'd think, because cars were few and far between (most
are on arterials and highways), and going at a pretty slow speed thanks to the
urban form. The main positive effect for walking is that with buildings being
closer to each other, everything is more compact, and you typically need to walk
less to get to your destination, even compared to a dense American city like San
Francisco.

## Trains

Tokyo is known to have the best urban rail network in the world, and it was
a pleasure to experience it in person. The trains were frequent and comfortable,
the stations were clean and modern, the wayfinding was intuitive. Here are some
other neat things I saw
- Each station has a unique melody, that gets played after station name is
announced. Listening to these made the experience of taking a train just a
little more delighful for me
- I had a lot of fun collecting eki-stamps --- colllectible rubber stamps unique
to each station. Another thing that added delight to train travel

- We forgot our diaper bag on a Tokyo Metro train. In any other city, this
would've been bye-bye bag, but not in Tokyo. The person at Nagatach≈ç station
called and tried to locate the bag, but the train had already
[through-run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_service) onto a Tobu line.
Called Tobu, and they located the bag, with all contents still there. I had to
go to Minami Kurihashi at the end of the line to get it, but was rewarded with
the prettiest Eki stamp
- Fare gates are default open instead of default closed. If you tap your fare
card, they stay open. If you don't, or if you have insufficent balance, they
close on you preventing you from getting out. Helps increase throughput, as well
as presumably decrease the amount of maintenance needed on moving parts.
- If you do have insufficient funds when you tap when exiting a fare gate, and
need to refill the balance, the machine remembers your tap, and gives you an
option to refill with just the right amount, leaving your balance zero after
this trip


## Order and Calm
Despite being constantly surrounded by people, Tokyo alwasy felt calm and
orderly. Tokyo station and the streets of Shibuya were some of the most crowded
places I've been to, and yet they never felt overwhelming. People
walked on the left side, car drivers respected pedestrian right of way,
sidewalks were wide. The hike up Mount Takao felt peaceful despite being pretty
busy. I give credit to great infrastructure, as well as a culture of being
respectful of others
