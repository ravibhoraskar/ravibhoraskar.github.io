title: Cool things I saw in Japan
type: post

Visiting Japan from the US for the first time felt similar to visiting the US
from India --- like coming to a more advanced place. Significantly better public
amenities and focus on everyday convenience means that quality of life felt
significantly better. Here are some cool things I saw there

### Baby infrastructure
Traveling with a young baby meant frequent breaks to feed and change diapers. I
was blown away by the abundance and quality of changing tables and nursing
rooms. The nursing rooms had air conditioning, a bottle warmer, a set to put the
baby in to bottle feed, and a comfy lounge chair to breastfeed. In Tokyo, we
generally found one at no more than a 10 minute walk from wherever we were,

- Transit and walkability
- Public restrooms available everywhere and clean
- Nursing and baby rooms --- open to the public, but still well stocked and
clean and air conditioned
- Convenience stores --- cheap and healthy food avaialble everywhere
- So clean. Despite no public trash cans, the streets and trains and stations
are super clean. People take trash home with them
- Order: Lots and lots of people at Tokyo station, or in the streets in
Shibuya, or on the hike at Mount Takao, but still felt calm and orderly. People
walk on the left, cars respect pedestrian right of way, etc


Cool things in Japan
- Fare gates default open instead of closed
- When you go to a fare refill machine after attempting to tag out with
insufficient fare, the machine remembers the exact amount to just exit
- In neighbourhoods, narrow streets: no street parking, no bike lanes, no
trees, no sidewalks. No cars, so actually pretty pleasant. Also leads to more
compact city, great for walkability
- No smoking outdoors, only indoors (in smoking rooms)
- Nursing rooms
- Train melody
- Pedestrian scramble, no need to wait to cross twice
- Eki stamp
- Lost & Found experience
