I had a similar feeling visiting Japan from the US for the first time as I did when I first went to the US from India.
Better public amenities, and a lot of focus on convenience means that quality of life felt
significantly better.

- Transit and walkability
- Public restrooms available everywhere and clean
- Nursing and baby rooms --- open to the public, but still well stocked and clean and air conditioned
- Convenience stores --- cheap and healthy food avaialble everywhere
- So clean. Despite no public trash cans, the streets and trains and stations are super clean. People take trash home with them
- Order: Lots and lots of people at Tokyo station, or in the streets in Shibuya, or on the hike at Mount Takao, but still felt calm and orderly. People walk on the left, cars respect pedestrian right of way, etc


Cool things in Japan
- Fare gates default open instead of closed
- When you go to a fare refill machine after attempting to tag out with insufficient fare, the machine remembers the exact amount to just exit
- In neighbourhoods, narrow streets: no street parking, no bike lanes, no trees, no sidewalks. No cars, so actually pretty pleasant. Also leads to more compact city, great for walkability
- No smoking outdoors, only indoors (in smoking rooms)
- Train melody
- Pedestrian scramble, no need to wait to cross twice
