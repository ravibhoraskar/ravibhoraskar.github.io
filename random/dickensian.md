title: "Criteria for baby names (Dickensian)"
---

*I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to make my [criteria for baby names]({% post_url 2022-08-25-criteria-for-baby-names %}). Here is what it came up with.*

Manasi and I have been deliberating over the names we should bestow upon our dear daughter. I thought that articulating the principles that guide our decision might help us arrive at a satisfactory choice. These are not meant to be a strict set of criteria, but rather a codification of my personal preferences. They are roughly ordered in terms of their importance (e.g. having a name that is easily pronounced is of greater concern to me than having a name with two syllables). We welcome feedback, comments, and name suggestions, which may be submitted using [this form](https://forms.gle/YT59sDZF2tQ4aDXg8). Thank you for your kind assistance.

- Names that are easily pronounced and not mangled by either English or Indian speakers.
  - For instance, Sarwadnya (which is difficult for English or non-Marathi Indian speakers to enunciate),
Pooja (which is often pronounced Poo-ha in California due to the Spanish influence), or Theo (whose fricative "θ" does not exist in Indian languages).
- Names whose meanings are not strange, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate in English, Spanish, Hindi, or Marathi.
  - For example, Hardik (which sounds like "Hard Dick" in English), or Laura (which, when pronounced in the Spanish way, sounds very similar to लौडा in Hindi)
- Two-syllable names are preferred, as I have observed that those with longer or shorter names often end up with two-syllable nicknames. For instance, Aditya becomes Adu, and Cleopatra becomes Cleo. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not my preference.
- Simple syllables are preferred over consonant clusters (जोडाक्षरे नको).
- "Classic" names are preferred over "unique" ones.
  - For example, I would prefer Kunal to Krunal, and Katie to Kassiani.
  - This also helps somewhat with internet anonymity, which is a valuable commodity in these modern times.
- Names with some ethnic ambiguity are preferred.
  - For instance, Tanya or Nina could be Indian or Russian.
